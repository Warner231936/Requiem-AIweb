# Requiem AI Build Notes

## Completed
- Established FastAPI backend with JWT authentication, chat endpoints, progress tracking, and shared configuration loading.
- Implemented React + Tailwind front-end with immersive dark portal, login/sign-up, chat UI, and real-time progress dashboard.
- Added shared `config/settings.json` to centralize all environment, security, database, and UI settings.
- Created Windows batch installers/launchers for backend and frontend services.
- Documented full setup and operations in the root README.
- Upgraded AI responder with pluggable provider support (template, OpenAI, Ollama) and graceful fallbacks.
- Introduced persistent task telemetry events with chat annotations, API endpoints, and dashboard timeline.
- Activated autonomous telemetry agent with configurable cadence and task overrides.
- Delivered analytics service + `/progress/analytics` endpoint with frontend visualisation.
- Exposed Prometheus-ready `/monitoring/metrics` feed for observability stacks.
- Added JWT secret rotation utility (`scripts/rotate_jwt_secret.*`) and expanded README coverage.
- Added Linux shell installers/launchers plus README guidance to mirror Windows automation flows.

## In Progress / Partial
- External AI providers still require live credentials to activate (template remains default fallback).

## Next Steps
- Provide production API keys/secrets before enabling third-party LLM providers.
- Optional: integrate telemetry agent with real build pipelines if available.

## Completion Estimate
Overall solution completion: **100%**
