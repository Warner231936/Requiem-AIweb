# Requiem AI Build Notes

## Completed
- Established FastAPI backend with JWT authentication, chat endpoints, progress tracking, and shared configuration loading.
- Implemented React + Tailwind front-end with immersive dark portal, login/sign-up, chat UI, and real-time progress dashboard.
- Added shared `config/settings.json` to centralize all environment, security, database, and UI settings.
- Created Windows batch installers/launchers for backend and frontend services.
- Documented full setup and operations in the root README.
- Upgraded AI responder with pluggable provider support (template, OpenAI, Ollama) and graceful fallbacks.
- Introduced persistent task telemetry events with chat annotations, API endpoints, and dashboard timeline.

## In Progress / Partial
- External AI providers require real credentials and network connectivity to activate (template still the default fallback).
- Progress events can now be ingested via API, but no automated background job feeds them yet.

## Next Steps
- Ship helper services/agents that push telemetry automatically from long-running tasks.
- Add analytics around task throughput (per-source counts, average completion time).
- Harden deployment for production (HTTPS termination, secret rotation, monitoring).

## Completion Estimate
Overall solution completion: **82%**
