# Requiem AI Build Notes

## Completed
- Established FastAPI backend with JWT authentication, chat endpoints, progress tracking, and shared configuration loading.
- Implemented React + Tailwind front-end with immersive dark portal, login/sign-up, chat UI, and real-time progress dashboard.
- Added shared `config/settings.json` to centralize all environment, security, database, and UI settings.
- Created Windows batch installers/launchers for backend and frontend services.
- Documented full setup and operations in the root README.

## In Progress / Partial
- AI response generation currently uses an internal stylized template (no external model integration yet).
- Real task progress auto-increments on chat activity but is not yet connected to real workloads.

## Next Steps
- Integrate real AI or LLM backend for dynamic responses.
- Connect progress metrics to live job metrics or background workers.
- Harden deployment for production (HTTPS termination, secret rotation, monitoring).

## Completion Estimate
Overall solution completion: **68%**
